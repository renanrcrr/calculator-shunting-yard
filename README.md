# calculator in Go that can evaluate arithmetic expressions 

In this project I implemented a calculator in Go that can evaluate arithmetic expressions with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses using the Shunting Yard algorithm and Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

It reads an arithmetic expression from the user, converts it into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) using the Shunting Yard algorithm, and then evaluates the RPN expression to produce the result.

It handles parentheses, operator precedence, and supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

You can further extend this code to support more operators and functions as needed.
